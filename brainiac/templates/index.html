          Currently teaching myself Python and going back-to-basics with data structures and algorithms. As a way to avoid forgetting this new found knowledge I've created this web-app where I  can test myself. For each discovery a memory card will be created with a problem and solution, however the solution is only displayed once you've attempted to work it out yourself.
